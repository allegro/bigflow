## Getting started

Start from [setting up a development environment](#installing-bigflow). 
Next, go through the BigFlow [tutorial](./docs/tutorial.md). 

## Installing BigFlow

**Prerequisites**. Before you start, make sure you have the following software installed:

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.7
2. [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/downloads-interactive)
3. [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)  

You can install the `bigflow` package globally but we recommend to 
install it locally with `venv`, in your project's folder:

```bash
python -m venv .bigflow_env
source .bigflow_env/bin/activate
```

Install the `bigflow` PIP package:

```bash
pip install bigflow
```

Test it:

```shell
bigflow -h
```
