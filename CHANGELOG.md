# BigFlow changelog

## Version 1.6.0

### Fixed

* Enabled vault endpoint TLS certificate verification by default for `bf build` and `bf deploy` commands. This fixes the MITM attack vulnerability. Kudos to Konstantin Weddige for reporting.

### Breaking changes

* Default vault endpoint TLS certificate verification for `bf build` and `bf deploy` may fail in some environments. Use `-vev`/`--vault-endpoint-verify` option to disable or provide path to custom trusted certificates or CA certificates. Disabling makes execution vulnerable for MITM attacks and is discouraged - do it only when justified and in trusted environments. See [https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced/#ssl-cert-verification](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced/#ssl-cert-verification) for details.

## Version 1.5.1

*Broken!* – DAG builder produces DAGs incompatible with (airflow 1.x + composer 1.x). Fixed in 1.5.2.

* Setting grpcio-status as <=1.48.2 to avoid problems with pip-compile on protobuf package
